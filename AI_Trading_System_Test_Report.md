## ü§ñ AI Analysis Engine Performance

### Qwen LLM Integration Success
- ‚úÖ **Model**: qwen3-max-preview successfully initialized
- ‚úÖ **API Connectivity**: DASHSCOPE_API_KEY working correctly
- ‚úÖ **Tool Calling**: AI agent successfully calling MCP services
- ‚úÖ **Strategy Generation**: Trade proposals generated and published

### MCP Tool Execution Log
```
[SUCCESS] Tool 'get_kline_data' executed successfully (multiple times)
[SUCCESS] Tool 'get_market_ticker' executed successfully  
[SUCCESS] Tool 'get_latest_price' executed successfully
[SUCCESS] Published trade proposal to message queue
```

### Analysis Workflow
1. **Data Request**: AI agent requests market data via MCP
2. **Tool Calling**: Multiple MCP endpoints called for comprehensive analysis
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Technical indicators analyzed by Qwen model
4. **Strategy Formation**: Trading strategy generated based on data
5. **Proposal Publishing**: Strategy published to message queue for execution

---

## üîç Identified Issues & Resolution Status

### Critical Issues - RESOLVED ‚úÖ
1. **OKX API Headers Bug**: Fixed invalid header construction in account fetcher
2. **MCP Endpoint Mismatch**: Added `/read_file` endpoint for tool compatibility
3. **Path Authorization**: Enhanced file whitelist management

### Current Limitations - IMPROVEMENT NEEDED ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. **Higher Timeframe Data**: 8/12 timeframes returning empty from OKX
   - *Impact*: Limited long-term trend analysis capability
   - *Cause*: Potential OKX API parameter formatting issues

2. **Tool Schema Alignment**: Some AI calls to undefined endpoints
   - *Impact*: Minor - fallback mechanisms working
   - *Cause*: Tool schema not fully synchronized with MCP service

3. **Account Balance**: Demo account showing zero balance
   - *Impact*: Cannot test actual trading execution
   - *Cause*: Using sandbox/demo OKX credentials
